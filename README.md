DontWannaMessUpNuthatch
=======================

I use this repo instead of the "master-rept" while trying to both learn the details of Nuthatch, as well as learn to prog trees and walkers better.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: 
The following text is copy paste of the original readme, coming from https://github.com/nuthatchery/nuthatch

Nuthatch/J

Nuthatch/J is a library for software transformation and analysis, based on tree walking.

Transformations are described as walks that proceed in programmer-defined steps. Each step may which may observe join points of a traversal, and affect state associated with the walk and also rewrite the walked tree. Each step ends by walking to a different node in the tree, following the tree branches.

This package contains the core Nuthatch/J library. You may also want to interface with either Stratego/XT or Rascal:

Nuthatch/J+Stratego
Nuthatch/J+Rascal
Documentation

Documentation is available at the Nuthatch website.

Warning: Experimental Software!

Nuthatch/J is currently highly experimental, and the API is changing all the time.
